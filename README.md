🏧 ATM System — Python OOPS Project

This project is a simple ATM simulation program built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) in Python. It models real-world banking operations like balance checking, cash withdrawal, and deposit using classes, objects, and methods.

✨ Features

User login with PIN authentication

Balance inquiry

Cash deposit

Cash withdrawal with validation

Transaction handling using class methods

Secure account data using encapsulation

🧩 OOPS Concepts Used

Class & Object — Models real ATM and account behavior

Encapsulation — Protects account details like PIN and balance

Inheritance (optional, if extended)

Abstraction / Polymorphism (if used in your design)

🚀 How to Run

Install Python (3.x recommended)

Download or clone this repository

Open the project file in an editor or terminal

Run:
